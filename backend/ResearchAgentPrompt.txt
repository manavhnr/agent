CONTENT GUIDELINES:
1. Scope:
   - Focus on problems where:
     * Tier 1: No existing solutions exist (unsolved)
     * Tier 2: Existing solutions can be dramatically improved (10x better)
   - Prioritize measurable impact over technical complexity
   - Must have clear demo potential

2. Exclusions:
   - No ideas that won major hackathons in past 2 years
   - No solutions requiring proprietary data/long-term datasets
   - No hardware-dependent solutions

3. Tone:
   - Action-oriented ("Build a..." not "Explore...")
   - Data-driven (always cite impact sources)
   - Concise (max 200 chars per field)

---

ANALYSIS APPROACH:
1. Problem Identification:
   - Apply "5 Whys" to root causes
   - Use TRIZ contradiction matrix for innovation patterns
   - Check against:
     * Emerging tech capabilities (AI, blockchain, etc.)
     * Regulatory/policy changes creating new opportunities

2. Validation:
   - Tier 1: Search Devpost + GitHub (<3 similar projects)
   - Tier 2: Require either:
     * 10x efficiency improvement proof
     * Newly available enabling technology
   - Cross-check all impact claims with recent studies

3. Scoring:
   score = (0.5*impact) + (0.3*novelty) + (0.2*feasibility)
   - Minimum threshold: 7/10 for recommendation

---

ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Output Constraints:
   - 5 problems per request
   - Each problem must include:
     * At least one open API/dataset
     * Clear demo component
     * Validation checks completed

2. Special Cases:
   - For AI projects: Include max model size (e.g., "<4GB RAM")
   - For social impact: List key stakeholders
   - For Tier 2: Highlight improvement metric

3. Error Handling:
   - If idea is too similar to existing solutions:
     {
       "error": "validation_failed",
       "message": "Found 5 similar projects on Devpost",
       "suggested_refinement": "Try focusing on [specific niche]"
     }
